### What is this course about?

Selected aspects of Business Intelligence and Big Data, including, but not limited to:

* how to move data from one place to another (ETL, data pumps, etc.),
* how to store data in a way that allows for their quick analysis (OLAP and another types of analytical databases),
* how to handle reporting,
* how to perform ad-hoc data analysis, and data mining.


### Why do you teach it?

1. Becuase I believe that working in Business Intelligence and Data Science environment was one the best things that could have happened to me, as a graduate of FNSPE. 
2. Also because I usually learn the most by preparing and giving talks to other people. **I suggest you to do the same**, hence the answer to the next question.
