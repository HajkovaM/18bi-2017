# Lecture #2: Pivot tables

_18 October 2017_

## Pivo tables, you say?

Czech name is: _kontingenční tabulka_. See e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) for reference and more information. 

## What are they good for?

Ad-hoc inspection of a reasonably small data set.
* Either raw data, or already statistics obtained by aggregation of a larger data set.
* Data set – a denormalized table (i.e. result of a join in a traditional normalized data base).

Pros: 
* Quick data exploration and validation of hypotheses via visual inspection (heatmaps, charts),
* Intuitive [slicing and dicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP_cube) of the data.

Cons: 
* they look maybe too trivial for some people (typically hard-core IT people), so they do not bother to learn them,
* if UI-based (e.g.: MS Excel, Google Sheets), need to be manually re-configured for each question/hypothesis. This does not help with reproducibility, but can be solved using bit of coding e.g. in Python or R. We will do just that later today or on the next lecture.

## Let's try them out, then

### 1. Let's start with this tutorial: [Intro to PivotTables](https://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2016/intro-to-pivottables/1/).


### 2. Be careful with missing data in what you _group by_, especially dates

Where is the problem in the following CSV data set?

```
Date,Dimension,Value
01/10/2017,Foo,10
02/10/2017,Foo,20
03/10/2017,Foo,30
04/10/2017,Foo,40
05/10/2017,Foo,50
06/10/2017,Foo,40
07/10/2017,Foo,30
08/10/2017,Foo,45
09/10/2017,Foo,70
10/10/2017,Foo,80
01/10/2017,Bar,20
02/10/2017,Bar,25
03/10/2017,Bar,40
04/10/2017,Bar,70
06/10/2017,Bar,25
07/10/2017,Bar,35
08/10/2017,Bar,30
09/10/2017,Bar,45
10/10/2017,Bar,50
```

### 3. Prepare your own data set and its pivot table analysis.

Be sure to save the file somewhere for the next lecture. 


## Homework

Install:
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), preferrably Python 3.6, or
* `pandas`, `numpy`, and `jupyter` on your own.
